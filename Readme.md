# Some Python scripts

I don't want to make new repositories for them.
So I made this repository.

## xkcd_downloader:
Downloads all images starting from the url specified in the url variable.

## no-ip:
Two scripts: one for syncing ip with hostname and the other for updating hostname from no-ip site so that the hostname doesn't expire.

For the IPupdate script you reqire requests module.
Install it by running this command: pip install requests

For the UpdateHost script you reqire selenium module.
Install it by running this command: pip install selenium

You can create a bash file or bat file for the first script. And then run it every few minutes using crond or task scheduler respectively.

## pig-latin:
Convert normal english into piglatin.
